DEV NOTES
tellraw commands with these messeges do not work, but placeholders like "tellraw @a {\"text\":\"placeholder1\"}" do work, idk why
we need these to be executed as the player that entered the BTD dimension so only that player will see them

conversation commands:
tellraw @s [\"\",{\"selector\":\"@s\",\"color\":\"dark_green\"},{\"text\":\"? You've awakened.\",\"color\":\"dark_green\"}]
tellraw @s {\"text\":\"So soon, thought it'd dream longer...\",\"color\":\"dark_aqua\"}
tellraw @s [\"\",{\"text\":\"Well, it's beyond the dream now. The player, \",\"color\":\"dark_green\"},{\"selector\":\"@s\",\"color\":\"dark_green\"},{\"text\":\", woke up.\",\"color\":\"dark_green\"}]
tellraw @s {\"text\":\"We left something for you in your home.\",\"color\":\"dark_aqua\"}
tellraw @s {\"text\":\"Use it well.\",\"color\":\"dark_aqua\"}
tellraw @s {\"text\":\"You may go back to the dream, a dream of a better world if you wish.\",\"color\":\"dark_green\"}
tellraw @s [\"\",{\"text\":\"We'll see you again soon, \",\"color\":\"dark_aqua\"},{\"selector\":\"@s\",\"color\":\"dark_aqua\"},{\"text\":\".\",\"color\":\"dark_aqua\"}]

SOLUTION:
Change from executing as world to executing as target/event entity (player)
