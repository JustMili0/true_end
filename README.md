# True End
Remember the end credits? All the talk about "Player dreaming of stuff"? Well, with this mod, you wake up. With this mod, you, as a player, wake up after beating the game and jumping into the portal.
Where you'll 'wake up' you may ask.. Well, in a dimension beyond your dream; that looks completely like the overworld (with a few missing biomes), right next to your cozy little house.

_Time to wake up,_
**_Player._**

## Notes
- "home" ~~sometimes~~ usually spawns in the ocean for some reason (versions 1.0-1.2)

Quick info:
Project first made in MCreator, them moved out of it and now we only rely on what's left of the MCreator project workspace (file structure, jars, etc)


<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>
In versions before 1.3, don't do much on the world as when you complete the game and get put into the Beyond The Dream dimension your items get cleared and you don't really have a way to  go back.
Updating from version 1.2 to 1.3 may cause world corruption as version 1.3 is a complete mod rework.
