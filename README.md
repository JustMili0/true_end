Quick info: Project first made in MCreator, them moved out of it and now we only rely on what's left of the MCreator project workspace (file structure, jars, etc)

# Description
Remember the End Credits after beating the ender dragon that most of us just skip over? Well, this time, they're a bit important you see.
With *True End*, you don't go back to your normal Minecraft world after beating the game, no, you end up in a familiar, yet a unknown world. You're told by the voices from the end credits that you've been sleeping, dreaming, dreaming of a better world.

## Lore? Maybe? Idk lmao
After finally beating the dragon, freeing The End, you jump into the portal to go back but.. something's different;
You hear some people talk, talking about you.
There you get to other side of the portal, but you can't see, the voices say you were dreaming, dreaming of a better world.
You open your eyes - your things are gone, you look around, you don't recognize where you are, but then you remember - *"It was all just a dream... "*.
All you have, is your cozy little house, a couple of items in a chest and a motivation to keep dreaming.


Wake up, *Player.*
