# Description
Remember the End Credits after beating the ender dragon that most of us just skip over? Well, this time, they're a bit important you see.
With *True End*, you don't go back to your normal Minecraft world after beating the game, no, you end up in a familiar, yet a unknown world. You're told by the voices from the end credits that you've been sleeping, dreaming, dreaming of a better world.

Plot twist, you're not alone either.

## Lore? Maybe? Idk lmao
After finally defeating the game and killing the dragon, you jump into the portal to go back, but.. something's wrong;
You hear voices, talking, talking about you.
And once you're out of the portal, you can not see or move, the voices say you were dreaming, dreaming of a better world.
You open your eyes, able to see and move again, yet you see that your things are gone, you don't recognize where you are,
and you realize - *"It was all just a dream... "*.
All you have, is your cozy little house, a couple of items in a chest and a motivation to keep dreaming.


Wake up, *Player.*
